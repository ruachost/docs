## API Authentication

The Ruach SMS API uses API key-based authentication. All requests require two authentication parameters:

- **ApiKey**: Your unique API key
- **ClientId**: Your client identifier

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```
https://accounts.netvox.ng/api/v2/
```

## Authentication Methods

### URL Parameters (Recommended for GET requests)

Include your credentials as URL parameters:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://accounts.netvox.ng/api/v2/Balance?ApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&ClientId=YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
```

### Request Body (For POST/PUT requests)

Include your credentials in the request body:

```json
{
  "ApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "ClientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "SenderId": "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  "Message": "Hello World",
  "MobileNumbers": "1234567890"
}
```

## Getting Your Credentials

1. **Sign up** for a Ruach SMS API account
2. **Navigate** to your dashboard
3. **Generate** your API key and Client ID
4. **Keep** your credentials secure and never share them publicly

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
Never expose your API credentials in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

- Store credentials in environment variables
- Use HTTPS for all API requests
- Rotate your API keys regularly
- Monitor your API usage for suspicious activity

## Rate Limits

The API has rate limits to ensure fair usage:

- **Standard accounts**: 100 requests per minute
- **Premium accounts**: 1000 requests per minute

If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Error Responses

Invalid or missing authentication will result in error responses:

```json
{
  "ErrorCode": 001,
  "ErrorDescription": "Account details cannot be blank"
}
```

Common authentication error codes:
- `001`: Account details cannot be blank
- `007`: Invalid username or password
- `008`: Account inactive
- `010`: Unauthorized API access
